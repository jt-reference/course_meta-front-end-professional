# Forking

The key difference between branching and forking is that the workflow for forking creates a new repository entirely. Branching cuts a new branch from the same repository each time and each member of the team works on the single repository.

Remember to _fetch upstream_ if you want to pull and merge the latest changes from the original repo.
