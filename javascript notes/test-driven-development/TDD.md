# Test-Driven Development

- Minimizes regression - that is, accidental bugs introduced to old code by coding a new requirement

- Proof that the new impementaiton that your new implementatin is not breaking other parts of the app.

- You can automate these tests easily so you continually verify that the system works as expected

- You can test your implenentations with various inputs and the tests become a type of documnetation for new members of the team.

## Steps to Test-Driven Development

1. Read the requirements of the project/task
2. Write the failing test
3. Update the Source Code
4. Run a test that passes
5. Refactor the implementation

This process is usually explained in three words:

1. Red
   1. The failing test
2. Green
   1. The passing test
3. Refactor
   1. The final tweeks to the code that don't change implementation detials, which can always be confirmed by running another test.
