/*
Join arrays, objects using the rest operator
Using the spread operator, it's easy to concatenate arrays:
*/
const fruits = ["apple", "pear", "plum"];
const berries = ["blueberry", "strawberry"];
const fruitsAndBerries = [...fruits, ...berries]; // concatenate
console.log(fruitsAndBerries); // outputs a single array
/*
Here's the result:  
['apple', 'pear', 'plum', 'blueberry', 'strawberry']
*/

// It's also easy to join objects:
const flying = { wings: 2 };
const cars = { wheels: 4 };
const flyingCar = { ...flying, ...cars };
console.log(flyingCar); // {wings: 2, wheels: 4}

/*
Add new members to arrays without using the push() method
Here's how to use the spread operator to easily add one or more members to an existing array:
*/
let veggies = ["onion", "parsley"];
veggies = [...veggies, "carrot", "beetroot"];
console.log(veggies);
/*
Here's the output:
['onion', 'parsley', 'carrot', 'beetroot']
*/

/*
Convert a string to an array using the spread operator
Given a string, it's easy to spread it out into separate array items:
*/
const greeting = "Hello";
const arrayOfChars = [...greeting];
console.log(arrayOfChars); // Â ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']

/*
Copy either an object or an array into a separate one
Here's how to copy an object into a completely separate object, using the spread operator.
*/
const car1 = {
  speed: 200,
  color: "yellow",
};
const car2 = { ...car1 };

car1.speed = 201;

console.log(car1.speed, car2.speed); // The output is 201, 200.

// You can copy an array into a completely separate array, also using the spread operator, like this:
const fruits1 = ["apples", "pears"];
const fruits2 = [...fruits];
fruits1.pop();
console.log(fruits1, "not", fruits2); // ['apples'] 'not' ['apples','pears']

// Note that the spread operator only performs a shallow copy of the source array or object
